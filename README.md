  ## Description
  This is my porfolio page! I created 4 different parts to this page - an introduction, about me, my best work I have completed so far, and how to get in contact with me. I only used HTML and CSS for this portfolio, making it easy to navigate and understand from a device with larger screen to a tiny smartphone.
